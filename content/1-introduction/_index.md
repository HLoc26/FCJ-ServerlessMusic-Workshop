### Overview
Building a full-featured music platform used to mean provisioning servers, setting up databases, handling file storage, scaling traffic, and writing tons of boilerplate code just to get started. But not anymore.

In this guide, I'll show you how to build a (mostly) complete web music platform, without managing a single server. The entire backend runs on serverless services from AWS, and the frontend is built with React and TypeScript. You'll learn how to wire the core functionalities of a music streaming platform such as user authentication, uploading tracks, streaming tracks, create playlists,...

Whether you're a developer exploring serverless for the first time or someone looking to modernize how you build apps, this project will give you hands-on experience with production-grade patterns - all in the context of a real-world app.
