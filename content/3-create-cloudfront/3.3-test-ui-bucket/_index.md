Before wiring up the full frontend, weâ€™ll do a quick sanity check: upload a simple `index.html` file to the S3 UI bucket and make sure it's accessible via CloudFront.

This ensures that:

- Your S3 bucket is correctly configured for static website hosting
- CloudFront is correctly pointing to the UI bucket
- Public access and caching are working as expected

---

#### Create a test file

In your local project folder (or anywhere), create a basic `index.html`:

```html
<!-- index.html -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <title>Serverless Music App</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello from CloudFront</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```

---

#### Option 1: Upload via AWS CLI

```bash
aws s3 cp index.html s3://your-ui-bucket-name/index.html --acl public-read
```

Replace `your-ui-bucket-name` with your actual bucket name.

The `--acl public-read` flag is only needed if your bucket policy does **not** already allow public read access.

---

#### Option 2: Upload via AWS Console

1. Go to the [S3 Console](https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3)
2. Click on your **UI bucket name**
3. Click **Upload**
4. Drag and drop your `index.html` file (or use **Add files**)
5. Click **Next** until the **Permissions** step
6. If prompted, **grant public read access** (or skip if bucket policy already handles it)
7. Click **Upload**

After upload completes, the file should appear in your bucket as `index.html`.

#### Test in browser

Now open your **CloudFront distribution domain**, which looks like:

```
https://dxxxxx.cloudfront.net/
```

You should see your "Hello from CloudFront" message rendered.

Once this test passes, you're ready to move on to deploying the real UI and configuring the audio file origin after Amplify is initialized.
